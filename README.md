# AtmosSpaceDynamics

**Last Updated:** 08-13-2020

## Purpose
1. Major refactor of the MATLAB files for Ashish Teewari's book *Atmospheric and Spaceflight Dynamics*
2. Conversion of those MATLAB files into Python code

## Languages
- MATLAB
  - R2018a
  - R2019a
- Python
  - Python 3.7.6
  - using MiniConda

## References
All applicable reference material is listed below. This includes books on programming that I have found useful.

### Books
[1] *Atmospheric and Spaceflight Dynamics* (ISBN-13: 978-0-8176-4373-7)
<pre>Tewari, A. (2007). <em>Atmospheric and Spaceflight Dynamics Modeling and Simulation with MATLAB® and Simulink®</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boston, MA.: Birkhäuser</pre>


### Original MATLAB code
Some of the files contained here are originally from the author of the following book and can be found at [MathWorks File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14132-atmospheric-space-flight-dynamics)

The original MATLAB .m files are credited to the author of the above mentioned book. No copyright infringement is intended! The author of the above mentioned book has no involvement in this project. This is purely something I am doing to learn more MATLAB and Python (and how to use GitHub). If there are any concerns about copyright please contact me and I will do my best to resolve them.

### Python files
The Python files are considered to be separate from the original MATLAB files and as such all applicable rights go to the author of those Python files.

### People
- **als0052**: doing it all, this isn't a community thing (unless it becomes one?)
